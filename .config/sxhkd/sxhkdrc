# The Simple X Hotkey Daemon is the program used by LARBS to map most of the
# dwm-independent commands.  This file is pretty readable, so I'll let you read
# it.

# The goal here is to use key-sequences instead of key-chords. This is heavily
# inspired by the spacemacs (https://www.spacemacs.org/) configuration framework
# for emacs.
